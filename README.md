## My process

Broke down design into simple boxes in my head and I dive right into development.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to center a div vertically and horizontally on a web page using position: absolute. This was the first I had seen something of this nature and I found it on stackoverflow (best place to find solution...lol).
Also, in this challenge I noticed that it is better to specify the size of your divs using measurement such as 'rem' instead of percentages.
``` css
.container {
    background-color: white;
    padding: 1rem;
    border-radius: 0.8rem;
    width: 17rem;
    height: 28rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I'd like to master responsiveness in web page development. I don't think I have fully grasp how and when to use the tools available.

### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14123999/center-a-div-horizontally-and-vertically) - This helped me in centering the container div and ensuring responsiveness. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
